							<div class="blog_post_text">
								<p>Throughout the years, our company registration experts, certified with the Corporate Affairs Commission have been giving an exhaustive scope and model for registering companies in Nigeria and in the UAE. With over 200 companies registered within 2 years of our operation, we are poised to registering 1000 companies by 2020, a vision which has kept driving us with Delivery, Professionalism and Versatility being our watchword.</p>

								<p>A registered company becomes a separate legal entity from you and has virtually the same legal rights as you would have under law, while an enterpriseA registered company becomes a separate legal entity from you and has virtually the same legal rights as you would have under law, while an enterpriseA registered company becomes a separate legal entity from you and has virtually the same legal rights as you would have under law, while an enterpriseA registered company becomes a separate legal entity from you and has virtually the same legal rights as you would have under law, while an enterpriseA registered company becomes a separate legal entity from you and has virtually the same legal rights as you would have under law, while an enterpriseOur firm provides the following services with regards to Company Set up and Registration:-</p>
								<br>
								<h4>1.	Sole Proprietorship (Also called an Enterprise or Business Name)</h4>

								<p>A sole proprietorship company from its name is owned by a single person. It is the simplest form of business entity, not mandatorily requiring a company registration. In such a company, the sole proprietor is personally responsible for all aspects of the business and has unlimited liability to all debts and obligations. It is not a full company, as it connotes the name of the company is registered with the regulatory commission but has its deficiencies. Most contracts cannot be bid for with this kind of company, as it is suitable for a retail business. Though has an advantage of less taxation and reduced bank charges. </p>

								<h4>2. Private Limited Company</h4>

								<p>A private company is a company with a minimum of 2 shareholders and directors, and a maximum of 50 directors. A private company is one that has been stated in its memorandum and article to be private excluding bona fide employees of the company. It shall not allow the public to buy shares or debentures or deposit money for fixed periods or payable at call whether or not interest bearing. If a company defaults on the provisions of section 22 of the decree, the company shall cease to be entitled to the privileges and exemptions conferred on private companies by or under the decree. The Decree shall then apply to the company as if it is not a private company. A private limited company is a corporate entity separate from its shareholders, who enjoy limited liability, i.e., their personal possessions remain separate, and their risk is reduced to only the money they have invested in the company. The requirements for incorporating a private limited company in Nigeria are: </p>


							<div >
								<p>The total number of members in the company must not exceed 50, excluding those who are employees of the company</p>

								<p>The company must have a registered office in Nigeria</p>

								<p>A minimumof 2 people above 18 years of age must subscribe to the Memorandum &Articles of Association (MAA)</p>

								<p>The name of the company must not be the same as any other company name currently held in the registry of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)</p>
		
								<h4>3.  Public Limited Company</h4>

								<p>A public company, unlike a private limited one, is allowed to be publicly listed and sell its shares to the public.The cost of running a public limited company is considerably higher than that of a private limited liability company. Therefore, a public limited company is better suited for large organizations. </p>

								<p>Public Company: Any company that is not a private company shall be a public company and its memorandum shall state so. Every public company shall have capital except those limited by guarantee-those formed for promoting commerce, arts, science, religion, culture, education, research, charity etc. The total liability of a company limited by guarantee shall not be less than N10,000</p>

								<h4>4. Guarantee Company</h4>

								<p>A guarantee company is not meant for profit purposes and set up generally by charitable organizations. Such a company does not have a share capital, and the members do not own the company, nor do they receive any profits. They also have no claim to the company’s assets. All income generated by a guarantee company is used to cover its operating costs and to achieve the objectives of the company </p>

								<p>Company Limited by Guarantee: The liability of its members is limited by such amounts as the members may thereby undertake to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up. It may not be incorporated with the objective of carrying on business for the purpose of making profits for distribution to its members. When a company is formed for the purpose of promoting the arts, science, religion, sports, culture, education, research, charity etc., and the income and property of the company are to be applied solely towards the promotion of its objects and no portion is to be paid directly or indirectly to its members except as permitted by the decree, the company shall not be registered as a company limited by shares but as a company limited by guarantee.</p>

								<p>Unlimited Company: no limit on the liability of its members. All unlimited companies shall be registered with a share capital from the date of the Decree of 1990. If an existing company is not registered with a share capital then the memorandum must be altered so that is becomes an unlimited company having a share capital not below the minimum share capital permitted under section 99 of the decree. (Section 99, 1) If a memorandum states that the company is to be registered with shares and it is delivered after the commencement of the Decree, the amount stated in the memorandum to be registered shall not be less than the authorised minimum share capital and not less than 25 per cent of that capital shall be taken by subscribers of the memorandum.</p>

For instance, if the business is into rendering specialist services such as a Hospital, Consultancy, Schools, Media, etc, then provide a photocopy of the Professional Proficiency Document. e.g. A Certificate of Proficiency of a professional body, trade or association, an Academic Certificate, e.t.c.</p>

								<h4>REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTRATION OF CHURCHES, FOUNDATIONS, ASSOCIATIONS AND NGOs</h4>

								<p>Although an NGO is not a commercial entity, the Corporate Affairs Commission views it as an entity which needs to be registered nonetheless. There is therefore a laid down process for the registration of NGOs in Nigeria. This article will give a step by step breakdown of the process.</p>

								<p>The registration of NGOs is a bit peculiar in that it can be done under Part A of the Companies and Allied Matters Act as a company limited by guarantee or under Part C of the Companies and Allied Matters Act as Incorporated Trustees. This article will explain the process to register an NGO under Part C.</p>

								<br>

								<h5>STEP 1</h5>

								<p>As with all registration of entities in Nigeria, the first step is to conduct a search on the name to find out if it is available and to reserve the name if available. It is always advisable to have at least 2 names, one alternate in case the primary name is unavailable.</p>

								<br>

								<h5>STEP 2</h5>

								<p>NGOs and CSOs are supposed to be governed and managed by what is known as a Board of Trustees. These are the equivalent of what a shareholder/director would be in an incorporated company. The Trustees of an NGO or a CSO are responsible for the management and direction of the association.</p>

								<br>

								<h5>STEP 3</h5>

								<p>Once you have your name approved and your board of trustees in place, the next step for the registration of a NGO in Nigeria is that the Trustees must publish a notification of their intention to register a NGO. This notice must be published in 3 newspapers, one of the newspapers being one that is widely circulated in the area where the organisation will be based.</p>

								<br>

								<h5>STEP 4</h5>

								<p>The next step is to complete and submit the application form. The application form is self-explanatory and asks for information like the approved name of the NGO, the registered address of the NGO, a brief description of the aims and objectives of the NGO. The form also requires the personal details of the Trustees, this includes their names, sex, nationality, permanent residential addresses, occupation etc.</p>

								<p>The completed application form must be submitted alongside other documentation which includes an application letter, the original newspaper publications, two copies of the NGO constitution, the minutes of the meeting where the trustees were appointed, 2 passport photographs of each Trustee etc.</p>

								<br>

								<h5>STEP 5</h5>

								<p>All the documentation is then reviewed by the CAC, and if there are no queries, the NGO is registered with the CAC and can then commence operation.</p>

								<h5>What to do next?</h5>
								<p>Let's get talking. We are here to help you. You are a step closer to having your organization registered</p>

								<br>

								<h4>INFORMATION NEEDED TO BE PROVIDED TO REGISTER CHURCHES, FOUNDATIONS, ASSOCIATIONS AND NGOs</h4>

							<div class="blog_post_title"><a href="#">DEBT RECOVERY</a></div>
							<div class="blog_post_text">
								<p> In the area of Debt Recovery, our firm has been able to establish a niche for itself before individuals, Contractors, Private and Corporate organizations which form our clientele in Nigeria and overseas. Our Debt Recovery department has grown from a small beginning to a busy and functional department who are specialists in the act of debt recoveries, who are assisted by an integrated team of lawyers. We are able to pursue debts where it may be difficult or inappropriate for our clients to do so and where relationships need to be preserved with good clients by pursuing debts firmly and tactfully.</p>
								
								<br>

								<p> Our debt recovery department's clientele now includes Banks and listed Companies. We remain committed to the small and large creditors and have not forgotten the impact which a bad debt has upon small and medium-sized businesses. We have a proven track record and have achieved outstanding success in recovering monies and in rehabilitating delinquent accounts for clients at all levels by providing a personalized and cost-effective service through the use of sophisticated legal, efficient and technical experience in achieving our aims. </p>

								<br>

								<p> Our Debt Recoveries Department pursue a cost efficient solution for smaller debts, large high value debts and bulk debts. We involve the correct strategies to focus the debtor's attention on the fact that we mean business and have every intention of recovering the debt.  </p>

								<br>

								<h4>OUR APPROACH TO DEBT RECOVERY</h4>

								<p>We approach debt recovery differently. We go through the following steps when assessing the debt recovery situation:</p>

								<br>
							<div >
								<p>1. We assess the value of the debt and see if it is suitable for the lower or higher courts of the land, while firstly adopting the alternative dispute resolution techniques before litigation. </p>

								<p>2. We assess the attitude of the debtor to debt collection.</p>

								<p>3. We assess whether the debtor can, cannot or is willing/not to pay towards determining the strategies to finally adopt.  </p>

								<p>4. We assess and evaluate if the debtor is alleging a defence or not, or if there is a counterclaim against our clients and whether the debt is correctly documented with evidential documents. </p>

								<p>At TCCNAIJA, Our Debt Recovery Department generally provide fixed, affordable advise on small and big debts, while with larger debts and defended debts we ensure that clients can retain control of each step of the proceedings. </p>

								<p>We consult with clients at each stage of proceedings for updates and reassessment, benefits and associated risks of the current position. To help our clients realize the full potential of their businesses, we deliver prompt service and are accessible to them at all times. We recover loans and debts accruable to our clients, within the shortest possible time and manner available to us, while we engage the services of financial experts to collaborate with us in areas too cumbersome to demystify. </p>
